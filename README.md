## Marmalade.fm 
A site that showcases the finest grooves, beats and world music. 🍊🎶

It uses the Mixcloud API behind the scenes to fetch our mixes as well as using the Javascript audio along with React events and state to play our music.

We’ll also be adding multiple pages into this app, using React Router to move between views whilst our music keeps on playing for a smooth user experience.
